# SimplestSilkroadFilter

Code base to make an asynchornized Silkroad Server Filter.

You'll be able to set a proxy layer between you and your silkroad server, giving you the possibility to read/write/send/limit packets without too much effort.
Please, take the code as example since it has been made for academy purposes only.

The application example comes with the way to bypass restricted packets from phbot plugins.
At this case you'll be able to read SPAWN/DESPAWN packets from plugins by using a different opcode `0xF00D` which contains the following structure:

```
ushort PacketOpcode
* byte PacketBytes
```
